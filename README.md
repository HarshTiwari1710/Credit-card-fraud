# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Neural Network

This repository contains the implementation of credit card fraud detection using neural network. Neural network is a powerful technique for detecting fraudulent transactions. This implementation uses a supervised learning approach where the neural network is trained on a labeled dataset of credit card transactions.




## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the neural network is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions labeled as fraudulent.
## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- sklearn
## Results

The neural network achieves an accuracy of 99.95% and a recall of 91.84% on the test set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a neural network for credit card fraud detection.
